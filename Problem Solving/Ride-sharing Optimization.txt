Problem Statement:

You are tasked with developing an algorithm for optimizing ride-sharing among multiple passengers in a dynamic urban environment. 
The goal is to minimize the total travel time and distance while ensuring a fair distribution of routes and minimizing detours for 
each passenger. Your solution should consider real-time data, traffic conditions, and the changing positions of passengers.

Proposed Solution:
